# A MATLAB function for the computation of partial synchronization manifolds for delay-coupled systems

**Authors:** Wim Michiels, Hakki Ulas Unal, Erik Steur and Libo Su 

**Version 1**: The software (version 1) corresponds to the article "E. Steur, W. Michiels and H.U. Unal, Characterization and computation of partial synchronization manifolds for delay-coupled systems, in review for SIAM Journal on Applied Dynamical Systems, 2015". 

**Version 2**: Updated version improving the algorithm for the case of invasive coupling, updated by Libo Su. The improvements are described in the article "L. Su, W. Michiels, E. Steur and H. Nijmeijer, Computing partial synchronization manifolds of delay-coupled systems, Proceedings of the 9th European Nonlinear Dynamics Conference (ENOC 2017)".
